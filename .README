"""
The chat history functionality is implemented entirely on the frontend side using localStorage
for persistence. This makes the implementation simpler as:

1. No backend database is required
2. The backend remains stateless
3. Each API request is still independent

If you want to add server-side persistence in the future, you would need to:

1. Add a database (like SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB)
2. Create a sessions table/collection to store chat sessions
3. Add endpoints for:
   - GET /api/chat-sessions - List all chat sessions
   - POST /api/chat-sessions - Create a new chat session
   - GET /api/chat-sessions/{id} - Get a specific chat session
   - PUT /api/chat-sessions/{id} - Update a chat session
   - DELETE /api/chat-sessions/{id} - Delete a chat session

For now, the current implementation with client-side storage works well for
individual users on their own devices.
